# Hotel-Booking-Systems

In the realm of contemporary hotel management, the absence of a robust data warehousing solution has led to significant operational inefficiencies and missed opportunities for revenue optimization. Traditional systems lack the capacity to harness and analyze vast datasets, resulting in suboptimal decision-making processes. The hospitality industry is grappling with the challenge of offering personalized guest experiences without the comprehensive insights that data warehousing can provide. Current inventory management practices often fall short in dynamically adjusting to demand fluctuations, leading to underutilization of resources and potential revenue loss. Additionally, the lack of real-time updates on availability and pricing poses a hurdle to maintaining transparency in the booking process. Fraudulent activities pose a persistent threat, necessitating a more sophisticated approach to security. This problem statement underscores the pressing need for a data warehousing solution like DataStay to address these challenges and propel the hotel industry into a new era of efficiency, revenue maximization, and personalized customer service.

Our project's main goal was to create a data warehouse model that was especially designed to be used in the construction of an extensive hotel booking database. To successfully combine the relevant data, this project required integrating the Bookings, Hotel, Location, and Room tables. A star join operation was the main method used to do this. The approaches used in current warehousing initiatives are examined in this literature study, which also highlights the need of carefully linking tables to improve the general efficacy and efficiency of data administration in the hospitality industry.
